-- (c) 2014 Kai Howells, Automatica. kai@automatica.com.au - http://automatica.com.au
-- version 1.0 20140720
-- This builds on a how-to guide from Alex Narvey at Precursor Systems - http://www.precursor.ca
-- as well as my own testing and tweaking.
-- I would have prefered to have a way to restrict OS X Server's Websites to be restricted to just one IP on the Server,
-- freeing up any additional IPs for third-party services. This was possible to achieve under Lion server without too
-- much difficulty however Apple changed things (as is their wont) and the method I was using no longer works.

display dialog "This applet will create the necessary files for Kerio Connect to exist as a webapp behind OS X Server's reverse proxy" buttons {"OK", "More Info...", "Cancel"} default button "OK"
if button returned of the result = "More Info..." then display dialog "In OS X Lion and above with Server.app providing Services, Server is very aggressive at taking ports 80 and 443 on all IP addresses on the host.
With this app, you can configure Kerio Connect on a alternative ports for HTTP and HTTPS in the Kerio Connect Administration and then use the built-in webapp support in Server to reverse proxy the connections through from ports 80 and 443 to the alternative ports chosen in the Admin console.
You can then set up two new websites in Server's Websites interface and enable the Kerio Connect webapps on their respective ports. You will also need to export the SSL Certificate and Private Key from Kerio Connect and import this into Server to use for the SSL version of the site."
display dialog "Please enter the mail server's fully qualified hostname (e.g. mail.example.com)" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" default answer "mail.example.com"
set theHostname to text returned of the result
display dialog "Please enter the HTTP port for Kerio Connect (e.g. 10080)" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" default answer "10080"
set theHTTPPort to text returned of the result
display dialog "Please enter the HTTPS port for Kerio Connect (e.g. 10443)" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" default answer "10443"
set theHTTPSPort to text returned of the result

display dialog "Please enter the full path to the Kerio Connect mailserver.conf file" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" default answer "/usr/local/kerio/mailserver/mailserver.cfg"
set theMailserverConf to text returned of the result

-- This is the location of where Server.app keeps it's webapps and config files
set theApacheFolder to "/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/"
set theWebappsFolder to theApacheFolder & "webapps/"

-- The variables set here control the file names etc that it generates.
-- If you want to tweak things for a different application, for example,
-- then you can modify the Application and/or Reverse DNS names here...

-- The configuration plist files use reverse dns naming - put your domain name in here if you prefer. Ensure there is a full-stop at the end of it.
-- I could try and guess this from the mail server's domain name entered above, but whatever...
set theReverseDNSName to "au.com.automatica."

-- This is the name of our webapp, entered here as a variable so it's easier to change this for other webapps
set theHTTPName to "KerioConnect"
set theHTTPSName to theHTTPName & "SSL"

-- If you're tweaking names, you shouldn't need to modify anything below this line...
-- This follows a similar naming convention to Apple's included webapps
set theHTTPConfigName to "httpd_" & theHTTPName & "webapp.conf"
set theHTTPSConfigName to "httpd_" & theHTTPSName & "webapp.conf"

-- This follows a similar naming convention to Apple's included webapps
set theHTTPAppName to theReverseDNSName & theHTTPName & "webapp.plist"
set theHTTPSAppName to theReverseDNSName & theHTTPSName & "webapp.plist"

-- This converts the strings for the plist files to all lower-case. Doing it as a shell script is a bit quicker and far easier than trying to acomplish the same thing in pure AppleScript.
